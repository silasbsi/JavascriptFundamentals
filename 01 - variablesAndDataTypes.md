# Variables and Data Types

Variables are fundamental in any programming language, allowing you to store and manipulate data. In JavaScript, we work with two main types of variable declaration: let and const. In this guide, we'll explore how to use them and how to deal with the available data types.

## 1. Declaration of variables

In JavaScript, we declare variables using the keywords let and const. Both were introduced in ES6 and have replaced the use of var in most cases.

### <em>let</em>

#### When to use it? 
- When you need a variable whose value can change.

#### Characteristics:
- It has block scope, i.e. it only exists within the {} block in which it was declared.
- It can be reassigned.

#### Example:
```javascript
let name = "John";
name = "Mary"; // Reassignment allowed
console.log(name); // Mary

or

let number = 1;

if (number === 1) {
   let number = 2;
   console.log(number); // Expected output: 2
}

console.log(number); // Expected output: 1
```

### <em>const</em>

#### When to use it? 
- When you want to declare a constant, i.e. a value that cannot be reassigned.

#### Characteristics:
- It also has a block scope.
- The variable's value cannot be changed after its initialization, but objects and arrays can still be modified internally.

#### Example:
```javascript 
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.15; // Error: cannot reassign

or

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // Modifying the content is allowed
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Difference between let, const, and var
- **let and const:** They have block scope and are safer.
- **var:** Function scope and can cause unexpected behavior; not recommended in current code.

## 2. Data types in JavaScript
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to specify the data type when declaring a variable. The type will be inferred automatically.

### Primitive types

#### <em>string</em>
- It represents text.
- Declared in single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or template strings (````).
- Strings can be created as objects, using the String() constructor.

#### <em>Example:</em>
```javascript
let greetings = "Hello, world!";
let name = 'Jo√£o';
let message1 = `Welcome, ${name}!`;
let message2 = new String("Welcome!");
```

#### <em>number</em>
- Represents integers or decimals.
- In other programming languages, different numeric types exist; for example, Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript 
let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;
```

### <em>Boolean</em>
- It is a logical data type with only true or false values.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let approved = true;
let ofLegalAge = false;
```

### <em>undefined</em>
- A variable declared but not initialized.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let value;
console.log(value); // undefined
```

### <em>null</em>
- Represents an empty or intentionally non-existent value.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let result = null;
```

### <em>symbol (ES6)</em>
- It represents a unique identifier.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let id = Symbol('id');
```

### <em>bigint (ES2020)</em>
- To represent integers greater than **2^53-1**.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let bigNumber = 12345678901234567890n;
```


<br />


## Complex Types 

### <em>Objects</em>
- Structures for storing key-value pairs.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

### <em>Arrays</em>
- List of values.
- it is resizable and can contain a mixture of different types of data.
- JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays, and so array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string forms) as indexes.
- The first element of an array is at the index 0, the second is at the index 1, and so on - and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.

#### <em>Example</em>
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

or 

let list = ["orange", 1, 4, "John"];
```

## 3. Best practice tips
- You can always use const for variables that will not be reassigned.
- You'll be able to use let only when you need to change the variable's value.
- Avoid using var in modern code.
- Name your variables descriptively to improve readability.
